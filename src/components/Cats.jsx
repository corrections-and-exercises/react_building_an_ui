            {cats[0]} is a really beautiful cat, with a lot of sass and snuggles
            to give. He is {age()} years old and is looking for a nap companion
            during those tough winter months. He is very self sufficient, and is
            able to find a snack wherever he goes. No food at hand? Not a
            problem, he will figure out how to open your trash and invite
            himself to the delicious leftovers of that dinner you never
            finished! And if something falls on the floor, it will be gone
            before you can count to three! Take him back home with you!

            {cats[1]} is a charming older cat with {age()} years on her back.
            She is calm and moves about as if she owns the place. She is
            friendly with younger cats and kids, until a darn youngster tries to
            take her out of her cool. She dislikes being picked up and will let
            you know just how much she dislikes it if you try to, so best to
            leave her to her own antics. Olly really likes to nibble on feet at
            night so make sure to wear thick socks while sleeping! Take her back
            home with you!
